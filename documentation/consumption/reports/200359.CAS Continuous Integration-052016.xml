    <Comment>Only what artefacts that are requested, not the identity of the requestors is known, so measurement is based on the producers of the consumed artefacts.</Comment>
    <Comment>Key measurements are # HTTP requests to add, update or retrieve an artefact stored in the repo that is owned by an application, and the proportion of the SAN storage that is consumed by artefacts owned by an application</Comment>
    <Comment>A 75:25 Weighting toward SAN storage usage is given to the distribution based on both of the above measurements</Comment>
