# Jenkins Docker Images

The projects in this collection implement a fully functional [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) server.

## Overview of the images

This Git repository provides four Jenkins images.

1. **Jenkins**

  Implements a fully functional Jenkins instance. This image is based on the latest CentOS and adds the latest release of [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) and [Java 8](http://openjdk.java.net). If you are looking for a basic Jenkins installation that you can customize yourself this is the image you want.

2. **Jenkins CD**

  Builds on the Jenkins image and adds plugins that the CAS team finds useful in building Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines. In addition to common Jenkins plugins it includes [Java 7](http://openjdk.java.net), [Git](http://www.git-scm.com), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) and [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com). This is the image you want if you're building a Continuous Delivery pipeline.

3. **Jenkins CAS**

  Builds on the Jenkins CD image and adds CAS-specific settings and data volumes. This image is meant for use by the CAS team primarily to support the company separation and the use of Jenkins going forward.

4. **Jenkins Data**

  Provides the data volumes required by the Jenkins CAS image. This project is purposely incomplete and requires the addition of Jenkins configuration, security credentials and company-specific properties.

## Why develop a new Jenkins image?

The [Official Jenkins Docker image](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker) provides some of the concepts upon which these images are based. CAS feels that these images improve upon the official image with the following features.

* The images use the Linux [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) (FHS). This is the preferred directory layout for Linux systems.

* The containers created by these images can be immutable; all mutable state can be maintained in mounted volumes. This is a Docker security best-practice.

* Derived images can add plugins via their Dockerfile using the supplied `plugins.sh` utility. The official image provides similar functionality but requires the builder of the derived image to resolve transitive plugin dependencies manually.

## Basic usage

		docker run --publish 8080:8080 casci/jenkins

This will store all Jenkins work files within the Jenkins container. Check the Docker documentation if you'd like to store data in volumes outside of the container.

Directories you may want to consider mapping to volumes are defined by environment variables in the image:

* `JENKINS_VAR=/var/opt/jenkins`, contains all of the Jenkins configuration and directories Jenkins uses to build jobs.
* `JENKINS_LOG=/var/log/jenkins`, contains Jenkins log files
* `JENKINS_MAVEN_REPOSITORY=/var/opt/jenkins/maven-repository`, can be mapped to a local Maven repository such as on a developer's workstation.
* `/tmp`, the temporary Unix working directory.
* `/home/jenkins`, the Jenkins user's home directory.

## Attach build executors

Builds can be run on the master (out of the box) but if you want to attach build slave servers then map the port `--publish 50000:50000` when you connect a slave agent.

## Pass JVM parameters

It is possible to customize the JVM running Jenkins, typically to pass system properties or adjust memory settings. Use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable for this purpose either from the command line or in derived images.

		docker run --publish 8080:8080
				   --env JAVA_OPTS="-Dhudson.footerURL=http://my-company.com"
				   casci/jenkins

## Pass Jenkins launcher parameters

Arguments passed to the container running the Jenkins image are passed to the Jenkins launcher, for example:

		docker run casci/jenkins --version

This will output the Jenkins version just as though you were starting Jenkins from the command line.

Jenkins parameters can also be defined with the `JENKINS_OPTS` environment variable. This is useful when customizing derived images.

		FROM casci/jenkins:latest
		ENV JENKINS_OPTS="--httpPort=-1 --httpsPort=8443"

## Explore the Jenkins container

The Jenkins `ENTRYPOINT` script, in addition to allowing you to pass parameters to the Jenkins launcher allows you to run any command within the container. If you'd like to start the container (but not Jenkins) and explore the container from a command line:

		docker run --interactive --tty
				   --volumes-from jenkins-data
				   casci/jenkins bash

## The Jenkins image

The Jenkins image is based on the latest CentOS and adds the latest release of Jenkins and Java 8. The image defines important file system locations as environment variables for use by derived images.

The image installs the `plugins.sh` utility. Derived images can provide a file containing the names of plugins to install and pass this file to the utility. The file should list the short name of plugins, one per line (see the Jenkins CD image for an example). The utility must be run as the `jenkins` user.

		FROM casci/jenkins:latest

		USER root
		COPY plugins.txt /tmp/
		RUN chown jenkins:jenkins /tmp/plugins.txt

		USER jenkins
		RUN plugins.sh /tmp/plugins.txt && rm /tmp/plugins.txt

Derived images can place content destined for `JENKINS_HOME` into `JENKINS_REFERENCE`. The content of `JENKINS_REFERENCE` is copied to `JENKINS_HOME` without overwriting the content of `JENKINS_HOME` when a container starts. This allows the initialization of `JENKINS_HOME` when it is mounted as a volume (immutability of the base image) and preserves customizations made to a Jenkins instance via the UI.

## The Jenkins CD image

The Jenkins CD image builds on the Jenkins image and adds Java 7, Git, Maven and Ansible. It includes several plugins that are useful when using Jenkins in a continuous delivery pipeline. See the file `plugins.txt` for a full list. The image defines the environment variable `JENKINS_MAVEN_REPOSITORY` for use by derived images.

## The Jenkins CAS image

The Jenkins CAS image builds on the Jenkins CD image. The image installs CAS-specific Jenkins & job configuration and establishes the framework for a secured Jenkins instance. It enables the Jenkins HTTPS port & disables the HTTP port. SSH, SSL and Maven security settings must be provided by a volume mapped to `/home/jenkins`. The image also defines data volume mount points.

## The Jenkins Data image

For security reasons the Jenkins Data project contains only a Dockerfile, a sample configuration file & some helper scripts. The Dockerfile builds an image that is used to create a data volume container whose volumes are mounted by a container running the Jenkins CD image.

In order to create an image, add the following in the directory containing the Dockerfile:

		+ bin
		- company.properties
		+ database
		| - deploy.sqlite
		+ home
		+ jenkins
		| + m2
		| | - settings.xml
		| + pki
		| | - keystore.jks
		| + ssh
		| | - casfw-dev
		| | - casfw-dev.pub

* The `bin` and `home` directories of the `cas-jenkins` Git repository. This is the configuration (Jenkins & jobs) and scripts of the current Jenkins instance.
* `company.properties`: company-specific configuration settings
* `deploy.sqlite`: deployment history database (optional), the `database` directory must exist even if it is empty
* `settings.xml`: Maven settings. The file should reference the repository with `<localRepository>${env.JENKINS_MAVEN_REPOSITORY}</localRepository>`.
* `keystore.jks`: a Java Keystore containing the company CA certificate and the server certificate & private key (see below)
* `casfw-dev`: the `casfw` user's private key
* `casfw-dev.pub`: the `casfw` user's public key

Build the image.

		docker build --tag casci/jenkins-data-hpq:latest .

Create the container.

		docker create --name hpq-data casci/jenkins-data-hpq

### Create the `keystore.jks` file

Create the keystore & a key pair. Note that the private key password and the keystore password must be the same.

		keytool -genkey
				-keyalg RSA -keysize 2048
				-keystore keystore.jks -storepass changeit -keypass changeit
				-alias cas-cd.corp.hp.com

Create a certificate signing request (CSR) for the server.

		keytool -certreq
				-keystore keystore.jks -storepass changeit -keypass changeit
				-alias cas-cd.corp.hp.com
				-file cas-cd.corp.hp.com.csr

Submit the CSR to the company Certificate Authority (CA). The CA will reply with a server certificate.

Import the CA certificate.

		keytool -import -trustcacerts
				-keystore keystore.jks -storepass changeit
				-alias authority
				-file hpca2ssG2_ns.crt

Import the server certificate.

		keytool -import -trustcacerts
				-keystore keystore.jks -storepass changeit -keypass changeit
				-alias cas-cd.corp.hp.com
				-file cas-cd.corp.hp.com.crt

## Run the Jenkins CAS image

A command similar to the following is used to run the Jenkins CAS image:

		docker run --read-only \
				   --publish 8443:8443 \
				   --volumes-from hpq-data \
				   casci/jenkins-cas

## Add credentials

Access the running Jenkins instance at `http://<host>:8443`. Navigate to *Manage Jenkins â†’ Manage Credentials* and upload `ansible_vault.txt` and enter the password for the `cas-tf-git` TeamForge user.
